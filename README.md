# Discordeno Bot Template

This repo is meant as a template which you can use to create a Discord bot very easily using the [Discordeno library](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno).

[Website/Guide:](https://discordeno.netlify.app/)

[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/J4NqJ72)

## Pre-requisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land)

## Step By Step

1. Create your own repo using the template button. It is next to the button where you get the url to clone. It will say `Use this template` This is a template repo.
2. Clone your own repo that Github created for you. `git clone url-here-for-your-repo`
3. Create your `configs.ts` file in the main folder.

```ts
// Step 1: Remove the `.example` from this file name so it is called `configs.ts`
// Step 2: Add all your bot's information below. The only required one is token and prefix. NOTE: As long as `.gitignore` file is ignoring configs.ts your configurations will be kept private!
// Step 3: Remove these comments if you like.

export const configs = {
  // Your bot token goes here
  token: "",
  // The default prefix for your bot. Don't worry guilds can change this later.
  prefix: "!",
  // This isn't required but you can add bot list api keys here.
  botListTokens: {
    DISCORD_BOT_ORG: "",
    BOTS_ON_DISCORD: "",
    DISCORD_BOT_LIST: "",
    BOTS_FOR_DISCORD: "",
    DISCORD_BOATS: "",
    DISCORD_BOTS_GG: "",
    DISCORD_BOTS_GROUP: "",
  },
  // This is the server id for your bot's main server where users can get help/support
  supportServerID: "",
  // These are channel ids that will enable some functionality
  channelIDs: {
    // When a translation is missing this is the channel you will be alerted in.
    missingTranslation: "",
    // When an error occurs, we will try and log it to this channel
    errorChannelID: "",
  },
  // These are the role ids that will enable some functionality.
  roleIDs: {
    // If you have a patreon set up you can add the patreon vip role id here.
    patreonVIPRoleID: "",
  },
  // These are the user ids that will enable some functionality.
  userIDs: {
    // You can delete the `as string[]` when you add atleast 1 id in them.
    // The user ids for the support team
    botSupporters: [] as string[],
    // The user ids for the other devs on your team
    botDevs: [] as string[],
    // The user ids who have complete 100% access to your bot
    botOwners: [] as string[],
  },
};
```

4. Start the bot `deno run --allow-net --allow-read --quiet mod.ts`

**Note:** To run the bot with [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2): `pm2 start mod.ts --interpreter="deno" --interpreter-args="run --allow-net --allow-read --quiet -r" `

The `-r` is short for `--reload`, it reloads your deno cache whenever the bot restarts to get the latest and greatest changes to Discordeno. You don't have to include it.

## Features

## Beginner Developers

Don't worry a lot of developers start out coding their first projects as a Discord bot(I did ðŸ˜‰) and it is not so easy. With Discordeno, I tried to build it in a way that solved all the headaches I had when first starting out coding bots. If you are a beginner developer, please use this boilerplate.

**Modular commands, arguments, events, inhibitors, monitors, tasks.**

- Clean and powerful commands system
  - Powerful argument handling including validating, parsing and modifications.
  - Easily create custom arguments for your specific needs.
  - Command aliases.
  - Cooldowns and allowed uses before cooldown triggers.
  - Author and bot permission checks in server AND in channel!
- Clean and powerful events system
  - Simple functions that are called when an event occurs.
  - Easily reloadable!
  - No possible memory leaks due to incorrect EventEmitter usage!
  - Useful events available to help debug!
- Clean and powerful inhibitors system
  - Stops a command from running if a requirement fails.
  - Easily add custom inhibitors!
- Clean and powerful monitors system.
  - Runs a function on every message sent. Useful for stuff like auto-moderation or tags.
  - Easily ignore bots, users, edits, dms.
  - Powerful permission checks.
- Clean and powerful tasks system.
  - Runs a function at a certain interval. Useful for things like unmute and updating bot lists etc.
  - Can be used for cache sweeping to keep your cache optimized for exactly what you want.
  - Botlists code already made for most botlists. Just add your api tokens for each site and magic!
- Clean and powerful languages system.
  - Built in multi-lingual support.
  - Uses i18next, one of the best localization tools available.
  - Supports nested folders to keep cleaner translation files

**Hot Reloadable**
