# TSC Bot

TSC-Bot is a discord bot made in TypeScript using Deno and the [Harmony](https://github.com/harmonyland/harmony) module.

Its purpose is to offer fun and utils commands for TypeScript/JavaScript/other developers on Discord.

## How to use it

I recommend you to clone the project and put your own token & owners, so you will be able to use all the commands.
Because some, like the `eval` command, can damage your machine if anyone can use it.
So most of the commands are private in the bot I use.<br>
You can see an example of what to put into the `.env` file into the [.env.example file](./.env.example);

However, you can still invite the bot with [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=801974521133269053&scope=bot&permissions=289856).
